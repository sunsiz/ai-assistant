## 🔍 **Remaining Legacy Strings Analysis**

### **10 Legacy Strings Not in Current Code:**
These appear to be old UI strings with emoji that are no longer used:

1. `✓ Content Translation`
2. `✓ AI Image Creation` 
3. `⚙️ Configure your API keys in Settings for enhanced translation quality`
4. `✓ URL Article Translation`
5. `🔄 Review and edit translations before inserting them into your post`
6. `Translate text content between languages. Use "Use Post Content" to quickly populate...`
